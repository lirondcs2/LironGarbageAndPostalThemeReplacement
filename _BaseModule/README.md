## Postal and Garbage Theme Replacement Pack

This Write Everywhere module replaces all postal signs in-game to have the USPS logo.

It also adds the USPS logo onto the Postal Van and Mailbox from the North American Theme.

Finally, it also adds the WM logo onto the North American Themed Garbage Trucks.

Requires Write Everywhere to work.

For best results, use the Recolor Mod and change the color of the mailboxes and the post van from yellow to #1674b6.

I plan on adding more options for postal and garbage companies in the future, but if you'd like to use your own just create your own WE layout using your own images and then replace the corresponding layout through the WE toolbar menu, under my mod's  name, and then under the Subtemplates tab. Alternatively, you can also create your own png images and replace the atlases from the same menu.

### Adding your own logo images:
To use your own atlases, simply save three PNG images into two folders, two images in a folder for Postal Logos and one image in its own folder for your sanitation logo, into Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\Klyte45Mods\WriteEverywhere\imageAtlases

Just make sure to name the main postal logo PostalLogo.png, then PostalText.png for its corresponding text, and for the garbage company logo, name it GarbageLogo.png. The sizes are 512x512 for postal logo, 512x157 for postal text, and 640x237 for garbage logo.
