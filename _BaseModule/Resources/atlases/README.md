Add here **new folders** to be loaded as atlases from your mod. All them will be accessible in any layout in the game by using the pattern in `atlas` attribute in the xml:

> `atlas="YourModDllName:AtlasFolderName"`

Ensure that all your layout files are referring the atlas with your dll name as context. The atlases also will be available when editing layouts ingame
